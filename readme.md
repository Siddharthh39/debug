## Problems Solved

### Daily Debugging Problems
- **Day 1:** Square Function, Count Vowels, Unique Elements, Longest Consecutive Subsequence.
- **Day 2:** HashMap Counter, Balanced Parentheses, Remove Duplicates (LL).
- **Day 3:** Find Max, Queue (2 Stacks), Binary Search (First Occurrence).
- **Day 4:** Remove Evens, Linear Search, Reverse Linked List.

### Real-World Project Challenges
- **Week 1:** TBD (e.g., Debugging a simple web scraper with performance issues).
- **Week 2:** TBD (e.g., Refactoring a poorly written REST API).

## How to Use

- Review the problems and their statements.
- Check the corresponding solutions and explanations in the respective files (`day1.py`, `day2.py`, etc.).
- Use the test cases to verify your own fixes and understanding.
