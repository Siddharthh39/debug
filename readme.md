# Python Debugging Practice

This repository is dedicated to improving Python debugging skills through daily problem-solving. Each day, a set of debugging problems (easy, medium, hard) is solved, with a focus on understanding error messages, fixing bugs, and writing robust code.

## Problems Solved

### Day 1

#### Easy: Square of a Number
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a function that returns the square of a given number.  
**Bug:** The function was called with a string instead of an integer.

#### Medium: Count Vowels in a String
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a function that counts the number of vowels in a string (case-insensitive).  
**Bug:** The function only checked for lowercase vowels, missing uppercase vowels.

#### Hard: Unique Elements in a List
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a function that returns a list of unique elements from the input list, preserving the original order (first occurrence only).  
**Bug:** The function incorrectly removed elements that appeared more than once, instead of just skipping duplicates.

#### Hard: Longest Consecutive Subsequence
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a function that returns the length of the longest subsequence of consecutive integers in an unsorted list. The subsequence does not need to be contiguous in the original list.  
**Bug:** The function did not handle duplicates and empty lists correctly.
